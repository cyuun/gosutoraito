**Game Summary:**

Gosutoraito, or "Ghost Light," is a light reflection puzzle game where a fallen samurai must navigate the trials of a mysterious shrine to finally put his soul to rest. Enter the shrine and dive deeper into the depths of a stony purgatory by guiding a beam of light from floor to floor with mirrors and prisms.

A more detailed description of the game, as well as Windows, Mac, and Linux builds, can be found on our [itch.io page](https://karasel.itch.io/gosutoraito).

The game starts out with a few simple mechanics - reflecting light with a held old/broken sword, and moving mirror fragments on pedestals. By using these mechanics, the player can reflect light through the room. Later, a new mechanic is introduced - using the sword to reflect light onto ghosts from many points in the room. The game gets progressively harder, combining all these mechanics in a scary environment, in which the user must hit all the  switches and use light to avoid/remove ghosts to reach the end. What's at the end is a surprise...
