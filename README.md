**Game Summary:**

The game is made up of three levels: the first, where you use a mirror shard to reflect light from a hole in the wall and get that light to hit a certain point in the room. The second, where you aim the light at floating ghosts to scare them away. The third level involves a foggy room with massive mirrors (almost a mirror maze). You must navigate through the room to reach the end, avoiding ghosts or using light to shoo them away.

The first level has two mechanics- reflecting light with a held old/broken sword, and moving mirror fragments on pedestals. By using these two mechanics, the player can reflect light through the room. The second has one main mechanic- using the sword to reflect light onto ghosts from many points in the room. The third combines these mechanics in an even scarier environment, in which the user must navigate a maze of these large, movable mirrors and use light to avoid/remove ghosts to reach the end. What's at the end is a surprise...
