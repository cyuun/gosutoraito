**Initial Brainstorming:**
Ghost Light is a game about a lone samurai exploring the ruins of an ancient temple. Evil spirits haunt the grounds and the samurai can only defeat them using reflected light, rendering his once trusty sword useless against these spectral foes. The original concept was more combat oriented, and involved fighting other samurai within a mirror maze, but for this game, we felt it would be more engaging to implement puzzles revolving around the use of mirrors and light rays to uncover secrets and pathways hidden throughout the temple. We also want the game's overall aesthetic to reflect the architectural and mythological tropes of Shinto temples.
