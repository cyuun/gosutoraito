## Progress Update - 11/21/19
We've begun implementing our core mechanics and user interface to control objects within the game. The interface for our game is very simple, and consists of a central crosshair (to know where the player is looking) and some icons in the corner which display the number of mirror shards they have, along with the respective buttons for using the mirrors/sword. At this point the mirrors reflect the light beam and their rotation can also be set using our new interface. Clicking on the mirror enters edit mode, where the WASD keys are used to control the mirror's orientation. The ghosts' AI and behavior has also been programmed so that they follow the player whenever they are in sight and in range. Using the right mouse button, the player can reflect the beam of light if it is coming towards them, and this can then be used to destroy the ghosts. When a ghost dies, it instantiates an empty mirror pedestal, which can be grabbed and moved using the left mouse button.

## Backstory
The main character of Ghost Light, who the player controls, is an old samurai that has fallen in battle and is on a journey to the afterlife. He lived quite a long life, and experienced many battles watching his friends die each and every time. Because he's outlived everybody that fought by his side in his very first battle, he feels like he has failed each and every one of them, and so throughout his journey to the afterlife, he becomes consumed by guilt, and has to face his mental ghosts of the past and everybody who he thinks he's failed. Being so old, and having been injured while dying in battle, he moves slowly, and can't actually outrun any of the ghosts.

## Initial Brainstorming
10/28/2019  

Ghost Light is a game about a lone samurai exploring the ruins of an ancient temple. Evil spirits haunt the grounds and the samurai can only defeat them using reflected light, rendering his once trusty sword useless against these spectral foes. The original concept was more combat oriented, and involved fighting other samurai within a mirror maze, but for this game, we felt it would be more engaging to implement puzzles revolving around the use of mirrors and light rays to uncover secrets and pathways hidden throughout the temple (the core mechanic). We also want the game's overall aesthetic to reflect the architectural and mythological tropes of Shinto temples.
